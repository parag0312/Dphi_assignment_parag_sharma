Good to get this when it was reduced.  I think that this is the biggest Sting so its quite a workout but easy and great fun to fly. It's certainly the biggest one I've got.  If you don't know Flexifoil kites are aerofoil kites - so no spars or struts to break as it's a wing shape and is aerodynamically designed.  The whole thing folds or squashes up into the accompanying rucksack.  Easy to get going and easy to put away and I had mine sorted was flying it within a few minutes.  Its a four line kite so you fly it via handles with two strings per handle (top and bottom).  Means you can do multiple loop the loops and 'fly' the kite across the sky really easily.  Also you can 'collapse' the aerofoil by moving the handles forward (or in fact just letting go!) and the kite just crumples and floats back to earth. With a little practice you can also land it upright and ready to fly again with just a tug on the handles.

Avid Reader on 20 Jan 2015 Got this beauty last week ready for a trip to the coast this weekend its my 3rd Flexifoil and they are as excellent as ever Good to get this when it was reduced I think that this is the biggest Sting so its quite a workout but easy and great fun to fly It is certainly the biggest one I have got If you do not know Flexifoil kites are aerofoil kites so no spars or struts to break as it is a wing shape and is aerodynamically designed The whole thing folds or squashes up into the accompanying rucksack Easy to get going and easy to put away and I had mine sorted was flying it within a few minutes Its a four line kite so you fly it via handles with two strings per handle top and bottom Means you can do multiple loop the loops and fly the kite across the sky really easily Also you can collapse the aerofoil by moving the handles forward or in fact just letting go and the kite just crumples and floats back to earth With a little practice you can also land it upright and ready to fly again with just a tug on the handles My daughters love them too Great to see this one reduced same high standard and on the whole I am happy with the kite and the way it flies but 3 0 6 Sept 2015 By foogy on 6 Sept 2015 Having previously purchased flexifoil kites in the past I expected this to be of the same high standard and on the whole I am happy with the kite and the way it flies but I was a bit disappointed with the cheap feel to the aluminium handles as my other flexifoil kites have has really solid plastic handles with super grippy rubber on them so kinda feel the aluminium ones are a step back although I am sure they would work fine but I just use my old handles on my new kite also the kite killers that strap to your wrists are poorer quality than my older ones as well so was not impressed by that either I just feel when paying top money for what should be a top quality product that is exactly what you should get Excellent kite let down by the handles 4 0 6 Mar 2016 By Andy on 6 Mar 2016 The kite is fantastic fun and generates decent power even in low winds The handles provided are in my opinion not good enough for the kite and let the overall product down slightly This was immediately apparent after the first flight out of the box ended badly I upgraded them to the prolink handles also from flexifoil and now I am a very happy with it Also worth mentioning the after sales care from Flexifoil was first class and can not praise them enough for sorting my problem out so quickly and efficiently If the kite came with the better handles as standard 5 stars all day long Photo is me flying it on the beach in very light winds love it Simply awesome for a bit of fun 5 0 21 Jan 2015 By D M Aufenast on 21 Jan 2015 Firstly the kite came promptly in a well sealed box and once it was unwrapped it was just what i expected from any Flexifoil kite simply brilliant really easy to control thanks to its four lines and handles making it safe and really easy to fly never felt like the kite is out of control even in winds its not really designed for In addition to its great control this kite is just so much fun Me and my girl friend would fly them together and every once in a while we would accidentally crash them in to each other kites i have had in the past have been damaged by this but these Flexifoil kites come off unscathed and are simply awesome for a bit of fun Excellent Outstanding Great 5 0 30 Jun 2015 By MR P CRAKER on 30 Jun 2015 Kite arrived in good time and we will packaged I managed to get the lines tangled whilst unpacking but if you follow the instructions I did not You should not have any problems Great fun to fly and easy to get the basics if you read the well written guide included Spent 3 hours out on the first trip ending when a gust of wind made me let go of the handles and the safety system bungee snapped I emailed flexifoil who sent a new set to me no problems Excellent quality outstanding service great
